# Scaffold
Scaffold is a framework to help building game engines. This is currently intended to help myself with prototyping with Vulkan renderers however, if I ever get around to building a game engine, this framework will be build for that purpose.

When setting up a repo I decided I would make this public in the event this project ever carries some use.

Please also excuse any bad CMake standards, this is my first proper project with CMake.
